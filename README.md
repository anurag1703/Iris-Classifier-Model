# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions:

~Iris-setosa

~Iris-versicolor

~Iris-virginica

The project workflow includes data analysis, preprocessing, model development, and deployment via a user-friendly Streamlit app.

## Features
### Data Exploration:
Visualizations for feature relationships and distributions.

Correlation analysis to understand feature interdependencies.
### Preprocessing:
Encoding categorical labels for the species column.

Standardizing numerical features for improved model performance.
### Model Development:
Training and evaluating multiple classifiers:

~Logistic Regression

~K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

~Decision Tree

~Random Forest

~Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy and classification metrics.
### Deployment:
Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

Users can input flower measurements to classify the species.
